Hi, my name is Will. I design and build websites for a living.

<p>
I use this site mainly to {" "}
<WhiteLink url="/writing" pathname="/">write</WhiteLink>{" "}
  about subjects that interest me (technical and non-technical), and to showcase what {" "}
  <WhiteLink url="/work" pathname="/">I've been working on</WhiteLink>.
</p>

<p>
So far, I've written <TotalWords />. Here you can check out <WhiteLink url="/work/portfolio" pathname="/">my portfolio</WhiteLink>. 
</p>

<p>
If you like what you see, you can find my email on the{" "} 
<WhiteLink url="/mail" pathname="/">Mail</WhiteLink>
   {" "}
  page. You can also read <WhiteLink url="/more" pathname="/">more</WhiteLink> about what I'm up to outside of web development. 
</p>

<p>
  Can't wait to hear from you!
</p>
