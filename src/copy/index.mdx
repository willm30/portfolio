Hi, my name is Will. I design and build websites for a living.

<p>
I use this site mainly to showcase what{" "}
<WhiteLink url="/work" pathname="/">I've been working on</WhiteLink>{" "} and to  {" "}
<WhiteLink url="/writing" pathname="/">write</WhiteLink> {" "}
  about subjects that interest me (technical and non-technical).
</p>

<p>
So far, I've written <TotalWords />. 
</p>

<p>
Here you can check out <WhiteLink url="/work/portfolio" pathname="/">my portfolio</WhiteLink>. If you'd like to discuss your project, send me an {" "}
<WhiteLink url="/mail" pathname="/">email</WhiteLink> outlining your requirements. I'd love to hear about what you're up to!
</p>
