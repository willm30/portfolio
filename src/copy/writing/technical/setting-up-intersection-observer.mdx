When building the blog functionality of my website, I wanted the table of contents to automatically show the reader's progress through the article. 

I'd already set it up to highlight a list item that had been clicked on by checking if the link's href matched the hash in the url (exposed by <code>window.location.hash</code>), but I wanted it to update itself as the reader moved through the article. I felt it would look strange if the reader clicked on a link to a section of the post, then moved down two sections and the contents was still showing them on the link they clicked to originally. 

## The Intersection Observer API

Modern browsers expose an overwhelming number of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API">Web APIs</a>, of which the Intersection Observer is just one—but one that was absolutely perfect for my use case. 

What an observer will do is give you data about the relationship between a root container and a target object, and specifically, it will tell you if they are intersecting. 

Let's imagine you have a scrollable container, inside which you have some text (a blog post, say). What an observer allows you to do is initiate a callback function when some part of your blog post (a heading, for example) *intersects* its container—or, in other words, becomes visible. 

In my case, when an <code>h2</code> becomes visible, or intersects the article container, I call a function that sets the url hash to that of the heading, and then I force a re-render of my Table of Contents component. 

My contents component can then check which list item has a url that matches the location hash, and update its background and text colour accordingly.

## The History API

There's a hidden trick to the aforementioned, which is that if you simply try to set the hash using <code>window.location.hash = "heading1"</code>, it will trigger the browser to jump to that section of the article, *as if* the heading anchor had been clicked. 

But I didn't want this, because I wanted everything to happen silently in the background. I just want the reader to be able to scroll through the article and have the contents table update automatically; if every time a heading came into view the window snapped that heading to the top of the container, it would lead to a very frustrating viewing experience.

To get around this behaviour, I instead used the History API to set the hash. The History API also exposes the browser URL input, but allows you to set it silently, as I wanted.  

To do this, you can call <code>history.pushState(state, title [, url])</code>, where state is the state associated with the new entry you're making onto the history stack, title is the title of that entry, and url is the associated url. 

For me, state wasn't important as I only wanted to change the url, and title is, at the time of writing, an unimplemented feature in modern browsers, so I simply passed <code>null, document.title, `#${my-link-url}`</code> and fired the method every time an h2 comes into view. 

## Setting The Margin

With this, I was nearly finished, although I did notice one small problem: what if there were two headings visible simultaneously? I noticed this happening because the observer fires as soon as the target becomes visible (which you can specify as a percentage represented as a number between 0 and 1). Because I'm scrolling top to bottom, as soon as a heading peaked its nose into the container, the callback would fire, even if another heading was still visible at the top of the container.

To combat this, you can set a rootMargin, which essentially alters the dimensions of the container. This came in handy, because I was able to push up the bottom of the rootContainer by 50% of the width of its actual bounding rectangle, which means once becoming visible my heading still has to travel roughly halfway up the container before the intersection event fires.

To do this, I set the rootMargin property in the options object to: <code>"0px 0px -50% 0px"</code>. This pushes the bottom of my container's intersection boundary up by 50% of the container's width.

## Closing Remarks

And that's it really. See the gallery for the final code segments. I set the observer up inside useEffect and arbitrarily call a useState update function in order to trigger a render, which is what prompts my table of contents to check whether any of its entries share a url with the hash in the window's url. 

Anything I could clarify? Leave me a comment. 

P.S. I've since changed the margin from -50% to -30% as it wasn't catching the final header in some posts where I haven't written enough. Ultimately it's an art to finetune the margins exactly, but this seems to work for me for now.
