I'm always keen to learn new skills. With that said, I have to make choices about how I spend my time, and as a result, I keep a list of things I'm excited to learn for those moments when there's some space in my schedule. This I call my technical bucket list.

## NodeJS

My work with Gatsby is primarily client-focused. While there are a few opportunities to write for the Node runtime, such as when using Gatsby APIs, I'm generally writing client-side code. 

This means that my knowledge of server-side programming is weaker than I'd like it to be, and I'm keen at some point in the future to code my own server on some small, personal projects instead of relying on Gatsby.

## WebGL and ThreeJS

WebGL is a javascript API for working with 3D graphics in the browser, and ThreeJS is a library that permits the creation of 3D planes of motion. 

I'm really keen to improve my animation skills, and these two libraries lend themselves perfectly to creating websites that radiate luxury. 

## Svelte and SvelteKit

Svelte is a compiler that takes code written with Svelte's syntax and compiles it down to javascript. I find Rich Harris, Svelte's creator, highly engaging, and he speaks at length on the merits of Svelte on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=rich+harris">YouTube</a>. In his talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdNJ3fydeao">"Rethinking Reactivity"</a> he criticises React for its comparatively inefficient rendering process when compared to Svelte. In order words, he claims Svelte is faster. 

If there's anything in the web development community that can convince people to pick up a new tool, it's performance, and so I'd like to build some smaller projects in Svelte to get a sense of how it works and to future-proof my skillset just in case it does end up superseding React! 

That's all for the moment! What's on your technical bucket list? Leave me a comment.
