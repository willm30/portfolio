I'm in the process of documenting my experience of applying for and studying Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford. <br/>

These writings I'm calling the PPE Handbook, and I hope they are of use to future applicants in detailing the work, resources, and above all, mindset required in order to make a convincing application to study on one of the country's most competitive courses.

I bootstrapped the site using Gatsby Starter Blog. It was a near-effortless experience and I was able to deploy on GatsbyCloud within about 30 minutes of choosing the template.

As the site becomes more complete, I will look to implement a custom design. I'm specifically interested in adopting a wiki style over a blog style; I will not be contributing to the site indefinitely, and thus I want the content to appear evergreen.
