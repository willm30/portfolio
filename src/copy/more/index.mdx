Something that stands me apart in the web development community is that I'm completely self-taught: no CS degree, no bootcamps, just pure, self-directed learning with the help of the abundant goodwill of other community members who create educational resources for free. 

<p>
I use my{" "}
  <NavigateButton url="/writing" pathname="/more">
   <SpanRev>writing page</SpanRev>
</NavigateButton>{" "}
to contribute to this collective knowledge as best as I can, whether that be on technical subjects or from a business perspective.

Before I entered web development, I spent a few years figuring out how I really, *really* didn't want to spend the rest of my life.

<p>
Before that, I received my formal education from the University of Oxford, where I studied Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at Lady Margaret Hall. I'm in the process of documenting my experience of applying to and studying at Oxford, and here you can read more about what I'm calling the {" "}

If you'd like to work with me in person, you can send me an email on what you're looking for and we can discuss how I might be able to help.

Work aside, I live in Barcelona and speak Spanish to level C1 of the Common European Framework of Reference. This I also taught myself, mainly using Netflix, YouTube and listening to the radio. 

I'm also thinking about learning Catalan, given it's the only language people will speak to me in in Barcelona. I moved out here because I play rink hockey to a high standard, and am still at an age where I can make something of myself in the sport. 

Thanks for getting this far! It's clear you find my story interesting and I hope I can be of use to you in some way, either by working on a project together or through the writings contained herein.
