I received a brief to design and build an ecommerce platform for the display and sale of the corpus of a group of local artists.

Work included a custom, responsive template, ecommerce functionality including cart and payment, CMS integration, various animations, bespoke image magnification and carousel components, and site deployment.

I stayed in regular contact with the client throughout the process, and in the spirit of an agile methodology, we made incremental enhancements to the site as it took shape, while nevertheless following the outline of the design I originally prepared.

The client felt deeply satisfied with the final product and had this to say:

"William was fantastic to work with on our new site. Full of brilliant ideas; expert, from the big picture right down to tiny details; and incredibly focused on ensuring the remit was delivered on time, in budget and in a really professional spirit. We would work with him again and recommend him if you're after sharp and intelligent developing. Excellent to work with."
